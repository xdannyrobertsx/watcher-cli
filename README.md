super super simple cli that watches a directory (passed in as an argument) and runs git diff --porcelain on changes. it uses a different color depending on the amount of changes. wrote it with no ai for practice.

not pretty at all and can def be improved, but i just wanted to get it out so i could use it at work :-)
